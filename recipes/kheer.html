    <h3>Decription</h3>

    <p>Kheer is a popular Pakistani dessert. It is very similar to rice pudding, but a lot better. <br>
        It is usually made by boiling milk, sugar or jaggery, and rice. It can be additionally flavored <br>
        with dried fruits, nuts, cardamom and saffron.
    </p>

    <h4>Ingriedients</h4>
    
    <ul>
        <li>4 1/2 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup uncooked rice</li>
        <li>7 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>4-5 cardamom pods</li>
        <li>Crushed nuts (pistachio, cashews, blanched almonds) to garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>First, we are going to OVER cook the rice in boiling water for 10-12 minutes, <br> until they get really soft and mushy.</li>
        <li>Next, strain the rice and with the back of a fork, mash it well until it resembles oatmeal.</li>
        <li>Next, heat up milk in a stainless steel deep saucepan and let it come to a gentle simmer.</li>
        <li>Open the cardamom pods and add it to the milk. (Once Kheer is done, you can <br> take out the husk since we're only using 5 pods.)</li>
        <li>Next add the rice and sugar. The rice will be clumpy but as it cooks, it will break down.</li>
        <li>Now on very low heat, cook the Kheer for 3 hours. Make sure you stir every once <br> in a while. The milk will inevitably catch at the 
            bottom so make sure you use a stainless <br> steel pot because if you use a non stick saucepan, the brown bits will peel off as you 
            stir and <br> distribute throughout the Kheer. That would be gross!</li>
        <li>After 3 hours of slow cooking, the Kheer will have thickened. It should fall in little clumps <br> from the spatula</li>
        <li>Immediately pour in terracotta bowls and garnish with crushed nuts. The skin that forms <br> on the surface is the BEST part!</li>
        <li>Let Kheer cool in serving dish for 15-20 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>You can keep this in the fridge covered for up to 3 days but who's even saving for later.</li>
