    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>First, start off the rice. Fill a large pan with water. Add the salt, cumin seeds and cloves. Bring to the boil.</li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling, drain the rice and add it in. And, bring to the boil again. Then, turn the heat to <br> medium and cook for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the rice immediately. Spread it out onto a large tray so it can cool.</li>
        <li>Next, begin the chicken. In another large pan, heat the vegetable oil and add the sliced onions. Allow them to <br> cook on a medium heat until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Place the green cardamoms into a spice grinder, and grind. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Then, put the cloves, cinnamon stick, black cardamoms, black peppercorns and cumin seeds into the grinder. <br> Grind until a powder forms and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place the ginger and garlic into a food processor and blend with a little water until a smooth paste forms. Set aside.</li>
        <li>By now, the onions should be nicely browned. Remove Â¾ of the fried onions from the pan with a slotted spoon <br> and lay them out onto a plate.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces to the pan with the remaining onions. Stir fry for few minutes until sealed.</li>
        <li>Then, add in the ginger garlic paste, and stir in. Add in the salt, chilli powder, ground coriander and all the <br> 
            grinded spices (except the green cardamoms) to the pan. Give everything a good mix..</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to a simmer and cover. Leave the chicken to cook for 25 minutes or until cooked through.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the fresh lemon. Slice the green chillies through the middle and set them aside.</li>
        <li>Take the onions that we put onto a plate, and roughly crush them with your hands. Stir them into the plain yoghurt.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is cooked, add in the yoghurt and onion mixture. Throw in the dried prunes and the kewra water <br> as well. 
            Cook for a few minutes and then remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Now, to layer the biryani. Take a large pot and add a splash of water and a few pinches of cumin seeds.</li>
        <li>Spread out half the rice in the pan. Then add all the chicken masala and spread out evenly.</li>
        <li>Lay out the lemon slices and green chilli slices. Top with the rest of the rice. Sprinkle the grinded green cardamoms <br> over it and the yellow food colouring.</li>
        <li>Cover with a lid and place on the highest heat for 4 minutes. Turn the heat right down to the lowest and leave to steam <br> like that for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat off. Leave the pot covered and let it sit for 10 minutes before serving! Serve with the chutney of your choice and enjoy!</li>
